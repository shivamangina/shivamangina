### Hi there 👋

I first began my journey into code whilst studying Computer Science at SCSVMV,TamilNadu. During my time in the University I hated to code and refused to understand the magic of coding., During my final year, I started to learn a programming language called Javascript for my graduation project and fell in love ❤️ with the JavaScript. Thats how it all started.
I believe coding is magic✨, The magic which enables us to create everything the world has never seen before.
I build Webapps and UI for Websites. Actively looking for job opportunities.I love to work in high pressure startup environment.
